# Glyph vector stability

Answers [#14][issue-14], which §4 of [#1][issue-1] calls "the first thing to measure": does one
reference vector per character survive bold, italic, anti-aliasing and outline variation, or does
it not?

**It does not.** Not even close, and not even for upright regular text.

## Method

```console
$ cargo run -p xtask --release -- measure-stability \
    arial.ttf arialbd.ttf ariali.ttf arialbi.ttf
```

62 alphanumeric characters × 4 faces × 5 rendering sizes (24–96 px, bracketing the 21–50 px the
library survey measured) × 3 ink thresholds × 3 edge treatments = **180 renderings per character**,
just under a million intra-character pairs.

Every variant goes through `subtrackt_glyph::feature::vectorize`, the same normalisation the runtime
applies to decoded subtitle bitmaps, so these distances are the ones the matcher would actually see.

The two distributions that decide it:

- **Intra-character** — distance between two renderings of the *same* character.
- **Inter-character** — distance from each character to the *nearest different* character. This is
  the budget: a variant that moves further than this is closer to some other letter than to itself.

## Result

| Distribution | p5 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95 | max |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Intra-character, all styles | 11 | 30 | 46 | **65** | 101 | 228 |
| Intra-character, regular upright | 2 | 16 | 31 | **51** | 92 | 198 |
| Inter-character (nearest other) | 9 | **27** | 31 | 40 | 65 | 76 |

Median intra-character distance across all styles is **46**; median inter-character is **31**. Two
renderings of the same letter are typically *further apart* than two different letters are.

Restricting to upright regular — which is most dialogue, with italics reserved for emphasis and
foreign speech — improves it but does not rescue it: p75 of 51 against an inter-character p25 of 27.

## Which variation actually costs

| Axis | p50 | p95 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Anti-aliasing threshold | 8 | 35 |
| Rendering size | 11 | 38 |
| **Outline / edge, ±1 px** | **30** | 73 |
| Weight (bold) | 38 | 81 |
| Slant (italic) | 47 | 82 |
| Weight + slant | 55 | 93 |

Two things stand out.

**Scale and anti-aliasing are cheap.** Rendering size moves a glyph 11 cells at the median across a
4× range, and threshold variation 8. That independently confirms the normalisation in #7 works:
these were the axes it was designed to absorb, and it absorbs them.

**A one-pixel edge shift costs as much as character identity.** Nudging the boundary in or out by a
single pixel moves a vector 30 cells at the median — indistinguishable from the 31-cell median
distance to an entirely different letter. This is the axis nobody would have guessed was the
expensive one, and it is not a rendering artefact: it is exactly what varies when a subtitle glyph
is thresholded out of an anti-aliased, outlined source, which is every glyph this tool will ever
see.

## Conclusion

**One reference vector per character does not work.** §2D of #1 assumed it would.

**Per-variant reference entries do not rescue it either**, so the set-size estimate #14 asks for is
moot. The overlap is present within upright regular text alone, so enumerating styles multiplies the
set without separating the distributions — and it would make things worse, since more entries mean
more chances for a wrong character to sit nearer than the right one.

**The session cache becomes the mechanism, not an optimisation.** This is the second of the two
outcomes §4 of #1 anticipated, and it is the one the evidence supports:

> match by self-consistency within a stream, using the reference set only to seed labels for cluster
> centroids

The reason this works where a fixed set does not is visible in the table above. The expensive axes —
edge thickness, weight, slant — are *constant within a stream*. One title is authored by one encoder
with one palette and one typeface, so its own glyphs vary only along the cheap axes. Clustering a
title's repeated shapes cancels precisely the variation that defeats a fixed set, and matching
cluster centroids against the reference only has to survive what is left.

This corroborates the library measurement in [library-survey.md](library-survey.md) from an
independent direction: a fitted Arial set covered 46% of real glyph instances, and this explains
why.

## What follows

- **#10 needs redesigning, not implementing.** It is written as per-glyph matching against a fixed
  set. It should become: cluster a stream's shapes, then match centroids.
- **#9 cannot embed its way to a solution.** The fixed set identifies the typeface and seeds labels;
  it will not carry the load alone.
- **Reducing edge sensitivity in binarization is the highest-value single change available.** At
  p50 30 it is the largest cheap-to-attack term, and unlike weight and slant it is an artefact of
  *our* thresholding rather than of the source material.
